### Questions and Answers

Q: Why are you making this? <br>
A: While I am aware that making an FNF Engine in 2024 has no reason to it, especially when Psych Engine exists. I want to make this because I want to relearn Haxe and HaxeFlixel while also modding one of my favorite games to be personalized how I, and possibly many others, would like it to be.<br>
Q: Why should I use this engine? <br>
A: There aren't any big reasons, but I can list a few. The engine will be as lightweight as I can possibly make it, especially since I will be entirely seperating the base game into a mod it self. I will also be removing any unnecessary code and features from the game and either replacing them with lighter alternatives or removing them entirely.<br>
Q: How will the modding system work? <br>
A: Tough to say as I haven't implemented it as of writing, but I plan to make it use HScript.<br>
Q: Is there a Discord Server I can join?
A: Yes, how ever as of writing it is rather unfinished. Scroll up to join.
